ADC interrupt each 10 seconds. 

The main idea of the interrupt has been taken from the library NRF52_MBED_TimerInterrupt, from khoih-prog, in particular
from https://github.com/khoih-prog/NRF52_MBED_TimerInterrupt/tree/main/examples/TimerInterruptLEDDemo 

The problem with this library is that ISR timer do not support complex problems in handler or will be hang (really proven) 
so I decided to make a trigger in the handler and the read and write task in the loop.
